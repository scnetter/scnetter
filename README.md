## Kelly Netterville

My experience has covered multiple roles from Cloud Security manager for a VoIP Service Provider to System Test and Network Engineer/Architect. I'm currently working as a SOC Analyst.

I've always had a passion for software development and have even worked in a few development roles over the years. I've started to dig back into Ruby and Rails. I'm giving myself a year to 
get more proficient and build some of my own apps and ideas. The goal - longer-term - is to move into a remote development role where I can help support and build apps using Rails.
