## Kelly Netterville

My most recent work experience has been as a Cloud Security manager for a VoIP Service Provider. Before that, I worked as a Network Engineer/Architect.

Over the years, I've gained experience in various roles ranging from Software and Systems Test (Large Scale VoIP Traffic) to Senior Management.

I've always had a passion for software development and have even worked in a few development roles over the years. I'm currently working to transition into a full-time Software Developmer.
